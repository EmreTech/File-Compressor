# File-Compressor
 
Hello and welcome to my file compressor! This is using some code I found with my code to make this!

---How to run this program---

You can run this program from 2 ways. The text version, and the GUI version. They both do the same thing, but look different.
Text uses the Terminal to do it's actions.
GUI has it's own interface. That's why I dubbed this version GUI.
To run these programs, first, you must have your file in the res folder. Then, open up your Terminal. Type cd and find the file path to the ZIP Compressor folder. Next, type in java -jar ZipCompressorText*.jar without the asterisk. The asterisk means what version you want to use (i.e. Text). Now, hit enter. The program should run. Follow the program's instructions and then you are done! Make sure to have Java installed to get this to work.
